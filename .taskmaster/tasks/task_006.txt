# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the personal information form section for basic contact details and professional identity.
# Details:
Implement the personal information section according to F-003 specifications. Create form inputs for full name (required), professional title (required), email (required, validated), phone number (optional, validated format), location (optional), LinkedIn URL (optional, validated URL format), and portfolio/website URL (optional, validated URL format). Add a placeholder for profile photo upload (to be implemented later). Use React Hook Form for form management and Zod for validation. Implement real-time validation with helpful error messages. Create API endpoints for saving and retrieving personal information.

# Test Strategy:
Test form submission with valid and invalid inputs. Verify that validation works correctly for all fields. Test saving and retrieving data from the API. Verify that required fields cannot be left empty. Test URL validation for LinkedIn and portfolio links.
