# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create database models and migrations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define the database models for User, Resume, and related entities, and set up initial migrations.
# Details:
Create ORM models for User, Resume, PersonalInfo, Experience, Education, Project, and Skill as defined in section 5.5 of the PRD. Use Sequelize (for SQL databases) or Mongoose (for MongoDB) to define the schemas. Implement proper relationships between models (one-to-many, many-to-many). Set up initial database migrations to create the tables/collections. Add indexes for frequently queried fields. Implement validation at the model level. Create seed data for development and testing purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all models are correctly defined with proper relationships. Test migrations to ensure they run without errors. Validate that constraints and indexes are properly created. Test model validation with valid and invalid data. Verify that seed data can be loaded successfully.
