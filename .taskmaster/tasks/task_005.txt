# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build resume builder core structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundation for the resume builder interface with navigation between sections and form state management.
# Details:
Implement the core structure of the resume builder with a sidebar for section navigation, main area for form inputs, and optional right panel for live preview. Set up client-side routing or tab navigation between sections (Personal Info, Summary, Experience, Education, Projects, Skills). Implement form state management using React Hook Form with Zod validation or Redux Toolkit. Create a layout that supports both desktop and mobile views. Add auto-save functionality that triggers every 30 seconds. Implement basic error handling and loading states.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation between different sections. Verify that form state is preserved when switching sections. Test auto-save functionality with network delays and failures. Verify that the layout is responsive on different screen sizes. Test form validation with valid and invalid inputs.
