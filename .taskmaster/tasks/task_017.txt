# Task ID: 17
# Title: Design and implement additional resume templates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create 2-3 additional resume templates with distinct designs for different professional contexts.
# Details:
Design and implement additional templates as specified in F-012: 'Modern' (clean, minimalist), 'Creative' (design-forward), and 'Technical' (emphasizes skills and projects). Create responsive layouts for each template. Implement proper styling and formatting for all resume sections. Ensure templates are ATS-friendly with clean, semantic HTML. Use CSS variables for theming support. Create a template selection UI that shows previews and allows switching between templates. Ensure the selected template persists with the resume.

# Test Strategy:
Test each template with various data combinations. Verify that layouts are responsive on different screen sizes. Test the template selection UI. Verify that switching templates works correctly and updates the preview. Test with missing data to ensure graceful handling. Verify that templates are visually distinct and match their design specifications.
