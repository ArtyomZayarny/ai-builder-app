# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop resume dashboard UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the dashboard interface for managing multiple resumes with create, edit, duplicate, and delete functionality.
# Details:
Implement the dashboard UI according to F-002 specifications. Create a responsive grid layout for displaying resume cards. Each card should show a thumbnail, title, last modified date, and visibility status. Add actions for creating new resumes, editing existing ones, duplicating, and deleting. Implement visual indicators for public/private status. Create an empty state for new users with a prominent 'Create Resume' CTA. Use TailwindCSS for styling and Lucide icons for visual elements. Implement client-side routing using React Router.

# Test Strategy:
Test the dashboard rendering with various numbers of resumes (0, 1, many). Verify that all actions (create, edit, duplicate, delete) work correctly. Test responsive layout on different screen sizes. Verify that the empty state is displayed for new users. Test that clicking on a resume card navigates to the editor.
