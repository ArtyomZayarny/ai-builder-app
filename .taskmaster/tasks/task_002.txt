# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement user authentication system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a secure authentication system with email/password registration, login, and password reset functionality.
# Details:
Implement the authentication system according to F-001 specifications. Use bcrypt for password hashing with a minimum of 10 rounds. Set up JWT or session-based authentication with HttpOnly, Secure cookies. Create endpoints for registration, login, logout, password reset, and email verification. Implement rate limiting for login attempts (max 5 per 15 minutes). Add CSRF protection on all authentication endpoints. Implement account lockout after 10 failed attempts. Set up email verification for new accounts using a service like SendGrid (optional for MVP). Create middleware for protecting authenticated routes.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration with valid and invalid inputs. Verify email validation logic. Test login with correct and incorrect credentials. Verify that rate limiting works as expected. Test password reset flow. Verify that protected routes cannot be accessed without authentication. Test CSRF protection. Verify that passwords are properly hashed in the database.
