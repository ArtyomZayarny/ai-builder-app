# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement performance optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the application for speed, responsiveness, and scalability.
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations as specified in PERF-001 and PERF-002. Set up code splitting and lazy loading for the frontend. Implement image optimization and lazy loading. Configure caching for static assets. Optimize database queries with proper indexes and query analysis. Implement database connection pooling. Set up asynchronous processing for long-running tasks (PDF generation, AI calls). Configure a CDN for static assets and public resume pages. Implement monitoring and alerting for performance degradation. Minimize API calls by batching where appropriate. Ensure the application is stateless for horizontal scaling.

# Test Strategy:
Measure performance metrics before and after optimization (page load time, time to interactive, API response time). Use tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest for frontend performance testing. Test database query performance with explain plans. Verify that code splitting reduces initial load size. Test CDN configuration for static assets. Verify that asynchronous processing works correctly for long-running tasks. Test the application under load to identify bottlenecks.
