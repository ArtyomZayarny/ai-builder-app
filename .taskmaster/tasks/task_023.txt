# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement auto-save functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add automatic saving of resume data to prevent data loss.
# Details:
Implement auto-save functionality as specified in UX-004. Create a mechanism to detect form changes. Trigger save operations automatically every 30 seconds if changes are detected. Implement debouncing to prevent excessive API calls. Add visual indicators for saving status (saving, saved, error). Handle network failures gracefully with retry logic. Ensure auto-save doesn't interrupt user input. Create a central service for managing auto-save across all resume sections.

# Test Strategy:
Test auto-save with various change scenarios. Verify that changes are saved correctly after the specified interval. Test with network interruptions to ensure data isn't lost. Verify that visual indicators correctly reflect the saving status. Test that auto-save doesn't interfere with user input. Verify that debouncing prevents excessive API calls.
