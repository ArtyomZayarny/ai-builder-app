# Title: Develop AI enhancement UI components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the user interface for AI-powered content enhancement with side-by-side comparison.
# Details:
Implement the AI enhancement UI according to F-010 specifications. Add 'AI Enhance' buttons to the summary and experience sections. Create a modal or inline component for displaying the original text alongside the AI-enhanced version. Implement loading states during AI processing. Add buttons for accepting, rejecting, or regenerating the AI suggestions. Handle API calls to the backend AI service. Implement error handling and user feedback for failed requests. Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible.

# Test Strategy:
Test the AI enhancement UI with various scenarios (success, loading, error). Verify that the side-by-side comparison displays correctly. Test accepting, rejecting, and regenerating AI suggestions. Verify that loading states are properly displayed. Test error handling with simulated API failures.
