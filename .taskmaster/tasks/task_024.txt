# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement security hardening measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Apply comprehensive security measures to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities.
# Details:
Implement security hardening as specified in SEC-001 through SEC-004. Configure security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, Referrer-Policy). Implement CORS configuration with whitelisted origins. Add input sanitization for all user inputs to prevent XSS. Use parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection. Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints. Add file upload validation for type, size, and malicious content. Ensure all API endpoints have proper authentication and authorization checks. Configure secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite). Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information.

# Test Strategy:
Perform security testing with tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite. Verify that all security headers are properly configured. Test CORS with various origins. Attempt XSS and SQL injection attacks to verify protection. Test rate limiting by exceeding the defined limits. Verify that file upload validation prevents malicious files. Test authentication and authorization on all endpoints. Verify that error messages don't expose sensitive information.
