You are a Senior Product Manager. Based on the product description below, generate a complete, clear, and technically accurate PRD. The tone should be concise, structured, and professional. Do not invent features that are not supported. If something is implied by standard practice, you may infer it — but only when logically supported.

--- Product Description ---
AI Resume Builder is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, edit, improve, and share resumes online. Users can create resumes from scratch or upload an existing PDF resume to automatically pre-fill fields. The system provides AI-based enhancements for professional summary and work experience descriptions using Google Gemini (accessed via an OpenAI-compatible interface). Users can upload a profile photo, optionally remove the background using ImageKit transformations, switch between multiple visual resume templates, change color themes, download resumes as PDF, or publish them via a public view link.
